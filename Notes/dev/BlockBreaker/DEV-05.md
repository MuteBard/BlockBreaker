## DEV-05, Triggers:
We want the game to trigger an event when something enters a certain zone

### Create a game object and then edit the collider to extend to the left

If is Trigger is not checked then a collision will take place. If it is however then objects will pass through but the trigger object will notice them.

### Creat a script to call the correct scene
